# Linscott, Christopher - "Lit" Review

## Why the README?

`\print_bibliography` has not been working for me, but loading it on overleaf worked immediately, so I just quickly switched over there.

If you want to compile the document yourself, feel free to clone and utilize the MakeFile, but the bibliography has not been working for me.

So, if you want to see the bibliography (without having to go to refs.bib):

1. Go to https://www.overleaf.com/project/62205c84bb79021a24ae98b1
2. Click on my file: __linscott-lit-review.tex__
3. Hit `Recompile` (just as a check).
4. Read with the built-in viewer!
