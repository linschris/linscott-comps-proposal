	abstract = {Image segmentation is an essential phase of computer vision in which useful information is extracted from an image that can range from finding objects while moving across a room to detect abnormalities in a medical image. As image pixels are generally unlabelled, the commonly used approach for the same is clustering. This paper reviews various existing clustering based image segmentation methods. Two main clustering methods have been surveyed, namely hierarchical and partitional based clustering methods. As partitional clustering is computationally better, further study is done in the perspective of methods belonging to this class. Further, literature bifurcates the partitional based clustering methods into three categories, namely K-means based methods, histogram-based methods, and meta-heuristic based methods. The survey of various performance parameters for the quantitative evaluation of segmentation results is also included. Further, the publicly available benchmark datasets for image-segmentation are briefed.},

Clustering can be used to represent natural images for the purpose of object detection or image tagging. We partition an image using a rectangular grid, compute a feature vector for each cell, and use K-means to assign each vector to a cluster. The clusters can then be used as discrete attributes for representing the entire image (this is known as a bag-of-visual-terms representation).},

This new algorithm is called bias-correction fuzzy weighted C-ordered-means (BFWCOM) clustering algorithm. It can overcome the shortcomings of the existing FCM algorithm and improve clustering performance. The primary task of BFWCOM is the use of fuzzy local similarity measures (space and grayscale). Meanwhile, this new algorithm adds a typical analysis of data attributes to membership, in order to ensure noise insensitivity and the preservation of image details. Secondly, the local convergence of the proposed algorithm is mathematically proved, providing a theoretical preparation for fuzzy classification. Finally, data classification and real image experiments show the effectiveness of BFWCOM clustering algorithm, having a strong denoising and robust effect on noise images.},

	abstract = {Machine learning (ML) algorithms have demonstrated high diagnostic accuracy in identifying and categorizing disease on radiologic images. Despite the results of initial research studies that report ML algorithm diagnostic accuracy similar to or exceeding that of radiologists, the results are less impressive when the algorithms are installed at new hospitals and are presented with new images. This phenomenon is potentially the result of selection bias in the data that were used to develop the ML algorithm. Selection bias has long been described by clinical epidemiologists as a key consideration when designing a clinical research study, but this concept has largely been unaddressed in the medical imaging ML literature. The authors discuss the importance of selection bias and its relevance to ML algorithm development to prepare the radiologist to critically evaluate ML literature for potential selection bias and understand how it might affect the applicability of ML algorithms in real clinical environments. ©RSNA, 2020},
